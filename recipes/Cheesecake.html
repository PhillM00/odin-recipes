    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cheesecake is my husband, Michael’s, favorite dessert. In fact, the first time I met my future mother-in-law over 20 years ago,
         she told me the way to her son’s heart was through his stomach – and whenever she wanted him to do anything as a child, she bribed
          him with a slice of NY cheesecake. A traditional lady she may be, but I got the message loud and clear: learn to make a good cheesecake!
    </p>

        Though the ingredients are simple, cheesecake can be a little intimidating to make. Because cheesecake is a custard, it needs to be baked gently 
        in a water bath, and you have to worry about the surface of the cake cracking, as well as over or undercooking. However, with the right recipe and 
        a few pointers, a creamy, crack-free NY-style cheesecake is totally doable, even for beginners.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour 
            together on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined.</li>
