        <li>1 lb | 500 g boneless skinless chicken thighs, (or breasts)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 tablespoon minced garlic)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry white wine, (optional)</li>
        <li>8 oz (250 g) brown mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups (500 ml) chicken broth, or stock</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) heavy cream, 
            divided (thickened cream, light cream, evaporated milk can also be used)</li>
        <li>Extra salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 oz (250 g) dry pasta, penne or fettuccini</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh chopped parsley, to garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat half of the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs and sear on both sides until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining oil in the pot. Fry onion until transparent, stirring occasionally (about 2 minutes). Sauté the garlic until fragrant (30 seconds), then add in the white wine and allow to reduce to half (about 4-5 minutes). Add the mushrooms and cook for about a minute, while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour in broth and 1 cup of cream (or evaporated milk); season with salt and pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer then add the pasta. Mix well, reduce the heat to a slow simmer while stirring occasionally, until pasta is al dente (about 15 minutes). </li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese until it melts through the sauce. Remove from heat immediately and slowly add in 1/4-1/2 cup remaining cream if sauce it too thick for your liking. Adjust salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken into strips and stir through the pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley and extra parmesan, if desired</li>
    </ol>
